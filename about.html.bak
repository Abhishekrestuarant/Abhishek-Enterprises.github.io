        <h2>ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL</h2>
        <p class="title">SCIENTISTS</p>
        <p>Alexander Graham Bell is most well known for inventing the telephone.  He came to the U.S as a teacher of the deaf, and conceived the idea of "electronic speech" while visiting his hearing-impaired mother in Canada. This led him to invent the microphone and later the "electrical speech machine" -- his name for the first telephone. 

Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on March 3, 1847. He enrolled in the University of London to study anatomy and physiology, but his college time was cut short when his family moved to Canada in 1870.  His parents had lost two children to tuberculosis, and they insisted that the best way to save their last child was to leave England. .</p>
